This weekend, you'll just need to submit a link to your group repository that has:

-README write up about what the project is that includes what problem your model will be solving and which dataset you're using
-A branch for every person in the group
-An ERD / explanation of what you're planning to do for the database
-A diagram / explanation of what you're planning to do for the Machine Learning model

You don't need to code out the model or the database just yet, no worries!
